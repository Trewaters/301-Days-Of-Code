The daily log of Tre' Grisby's **#301DaysOfCode** challenge.

## Log
### Day 10: January 10, 2019

*Today's Progress:*

I worked on Jasmine, Mocha, Chai testing. Basic slides showing how to test JavaScript.

later I got sucked into a blackhole looking for ways to make githooks. This is a whole area I would need to dive into. Plus strengthen my shell scripting skills. I would prefer to use Powershell of scripting since I am on a windows machine, but I found a perl framework that might be more universal for working with a team.

*Thoughts:*

I am posting this idea for tomorrow (day 10). Work on integrating Github commits with Twitter post. I feel like it is more time than I want to spend making individual posts to Twitter. But posting to Twitter daily is what motivates others and helps me get visibility so it is important for the bigger picture. BUT why not automate that menial tasks with code.

Resources (from a quick Google search):
- https://gist.github.com/kylefrost/f3841e76749dc64f4b5e (not really working any longer)
- https://zapier.com/apps/github/integrations/twitter
- https://ifttt.com/connect/github/twitter

API links:
- https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/post-and-engage/overview
- https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#commitcommentevent

all Github api calls go to (https://api.github.com)

Githooks could be another approach ( https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks )
- https://githooks.com/ , has examples
- https://github.com/gnustavo/Git-Hooks , PERL framework for githooks

I don't want to share all the files I worked in today because it would be too many. Just say I did a thing and that thing made me happy! :smile:

### Day 9: January 9, 2019

*Today's Progress:*
Worked on Mastering typescript. working through classes, interfaces and constructors in typescript.

*Thoughts:*
The basics make me want to fast forward but I am forcing myself to read every word and make sure I catch the details. I was thinking it would be cool to have automation that post my log to twitter so I don't have to.

### Day 8: January 8, 2019

*Today's Progress:*
Worked on Mastering typescript. finished chapter 2. 

*Thoughts:*
I wish I was quicker but since I type out all the examples it takes me longer to get through the material, but I think it sticks better because I am coding it as I go.

### Day 7: January 7, 2019

*Today's Progress:*
Busy day. Didn't move forward on any life changing code but I coded. Luckily work is coding sometimes and I did that. I update the water district prices in MS SQL server. Worked through more of the mastering typescript book.

*Thoughts:*
Need to put in the first part of my day on code or I will not make progress. The time evaporates quickly.

*Link to work:*
None.


### Day 6: January 6, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
Worked through Chapter 1 variables.

*Thoughts:*
I don't enjoy covering basic materials but it is good to slow down and look at the basics. Typescript is so close to JS that it seems like I know all this already but there are some small things I learned. I will do this for a few days and see how it feels to spend my hour of daily coding going through the book. If it isn't as productive as I hoped I will move on to something else.

### Day 5: January 5, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
Jasmine, Mocha, Chai testing. Some wordpress updates for work.

*Thoughts:*
I didn't get to work on the book I was hoping to but I did get coding work done.

*Link to work:*
iyai website and techtonica cirriculum.


### Day 4: January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
Read very little. I had to figure out how to disable a false positive in VS Code when using typescript. This webpage helped me fix the issue (https://github.com/flowtype/flow-for-vscode#setup)

*Thoughts:*
Switching up my practice to be more guided. I have not stopped working on the iyaiContacts but I think I need to study with more of a purpose. My idea is to follow along with one of the O'Reilly books I have access to. The current one I am using is on TypeScript.

This is the book I am reading ( https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-TypeScript-Second-Nathan-Rozentals/dp/1786468719 )
Mastering TypeScript - Second Edition 2nd Revised edition Edition

### Day 3: January 3, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
Sluggish today. Not really firing on all cylinders. I did work though.

*Thoughts:*
I worked with the mongodb api route connection. Started a query to take input from the website and search for data in the database.

*Link to work:*
This is all on my machine. Link is a local path (..\CodingWorkshop\iyaiContact-express_gen).


### Day 2: January 2, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on my reverse array reps. Moved to the iyai Contacts input form. The Connection function is working but I want to understand it more.

*Thoughts:*
I am jumping around a bit with my work but I have a bunch of topics I am juggling.

### Day 1: January 1, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on reversing arrays multiple ways.

*Thoughts:*
Today was the end of a stretch of busy days and it was a holiday so I wasn't trying to do much today. This would be what I call the basics.
