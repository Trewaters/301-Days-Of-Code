## Log

### Day #: [Date]

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
I worked through another chapter of the Mastering Typescript book. Ended part way into TDD chapter focused on Jasmine.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:*
It is more fun when I am covering something that is or seems exciting. Like Jasmine testing. I need to write more test and it was exciting to crack into TypeScript and testing. I am intrigued to see how it is done.

### Day 21: January 21, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
Working through more of the Mastering Typescript book. Chapter 6 is covering older libraries so I skipped past it because I would have to relearn it later with the updates. Might as well work with the modern versions from the start, since I have a choice. I wouldn't skip if I needed to work with old code.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:*
I had to skip some material because it was dated but I did like the section on React. Probably because I don't know much about React so this was informative. I had to laugh a little because React adds extra steps to the development process but my coding peers seem to LOVE it. I don't get it but maybe with some experience I will. I am still an Angular (version 7) fanboy.


### Day 20: January 20, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
Got an answer for my API issue this morning. I needed to write my function to return a promise. After that issue was resolved. I moved on to Mastering TypeScript. Working with declarations more.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:*
I was happy to get an answer to my API issue. But I lost points on stackoverflow because they deemed it a duplicate question. I don't agree but I can't change it so whatever. I got the answer I needed and that is what really matters... TO ME. It shows I need to work with promises and get to understand asynch functions in JavaScript. I knew there was an async issue but I didn't know how to resolve it. As for Mastering Typescript, I am bored. The declarations section covers things that I won't do regularly but still need to know. Excited to move on to testing in a couple chapters, but for now 3rd party libraries are next.

### Day 19: January 19, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
Worked on an error I am getting from another project. My API is not returning data to the webpage, which is a problem I am getting help with. The rest of my time I am working on declaration files in the Mastering Typescript book.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:*
The API issue I am trying to handle is going through stackoverflow. I wrote a question that didn't have enough information for folks to help me. It is a balance trying to include enough code so other can help you and not including your entire code base. I struggle with this every time I ask a question on there. The other work I did this hour was to work through my book and that went quick. Today's practice was really trying to get the work in today and not miss it.

### Day 18: January 18, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
Finished chapter 4 with generics etc. Now time to move on.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:*
The whole chapter was interesting and will need to be revisited. I won't be re-reading this chapter but looking for chances to use generics, decorators and async. The examples in the book had issues. I think part of the problem was my ts compiler was set to es5. Things got a lot better when I bumped it up to es2015. All this is important material and I plan to practice it until I have it down.

### Day 17: January 17, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
Worked through more of the mastering typescript book. Finished up generics today.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:*
I can tell that I don't have a strong grasp of abstract classes, implements, and super(). I kind of get them but I struggle to fix them when there is a bug. That is okay. The foundation is there I just need more examples to strengthen my understanding.

### Day 16: January 16, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
Made good progress on Mastering Typescript. started next part of chapter.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:*
alot of the begining work was causing compile errors, which makes it harder for me to follow. I need working examples so I can see what works for the computer. Since these are experimental I didn't stress on it. I have moved to generics and that is much more straight forward, even though I am ending on a compile error because I ran out of time. Must go to an appointment NOW!!

### Day 15: January 15, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
Got into Typescript decorators.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:*
This was a bit frustrating because the decorators are Ecmascript7 and experimental in typescript. I think the books examples were in an older format so every time I went to compile I got errors. I didn't want to get sucked into a black hole of trying to fix the issue. You sometimes have to cut your losses. If something is experimental and you don't have a lot of time then that would be something to come back to later.

### Day 14: January 14, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
Did a great summary of interfaces, classes and inheritance with a factory design pattern.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:*
I enjoyed covering those concepts I just refreshed myself on yesterday. The example isn't perfect so I have compile bugs every time that I need to fix and that has been super duper helpful. I get to puzzle through what the error is telling me.

### Day 13: January 13, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
Finished up the chapter on classes. Tired and busy but made it happen.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:*
I enjoyed it, but my brain started to get scrambled when they introduced abstract classes. Plus I was annoyed having to write a constructor for every class. abstraction and extending is something I will have to play around with more.

### Day 12: January 12, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
I worked through part of a chapter in Mastering Typescript by Nathan Rozentals.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:*
I am in the classes and inheritance chapter. I must like OOP because I get excited when I can cover concepts like inheritance and get/set. I didn't realize it because I have been focusing on JS lately and there is less opportunity to do that with JS. Hopefully I will get to put more time in on this chapter today but we will see how things shape up.

### Day 11: January 11, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
Worked through more mastering typescript.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:*
Same thing as the other day. I know the concepts so going through it is tough to do, but I need to if I plan on learning this the right way. This makes me want to skip over sections but I don't know the Typescript way of dealing with this concepts so that means I have to stick with it. Once I make it through the rewards will be evident. 

:floppy_disk: *Link to work:*
When I go through basics I save the code samples to a file that I can reference later. This is my way of taking notes with live code.

### Day 10: January 10, 2019

*Today's Progress:*

I worked on Jasmine, Mocha, Chai testing. Basic slides showing how to test JavaScript.

later I got sucked into a blackhole looking for ways to make githooks. This is a whole area I would need to dive into. Plus strengthen my shell scripting skills. I would prefer to use Powershell of scripting since I am on a windows machine, but I found a perl framework that might be more universal for working with a team.

I was able to get my time in with Mastering Typescript later on. Now I feel like I made progress for the day.

*Thoughts:*

I am posting this idea for tomorrow (day 10). Work on integrating Github commits with Twitter post. I feel like it is more time than I want to spend making individual posts to Twitter. But posting to Twitter daily is what motivates others and helps me get visibility so it is important for the bigger picture. BUT why not automate that menial tasks with code.

Resources (from a quick Google search):
- https://gist.github.com/kylefrost/f3841e76749dc64f4b5e (not really working any longer)
- https://zapier.com/apps/github/integrations/twitter
- https://ifttt.com/connect/github/twitter

API links:
- https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/post-and-engage/overview
- https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#commitcommentevent

all Github api calls go to (https://api.github.com)

Githooks could be another approach ( https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks )
- https://githooks.com/ , has examples
- https://github.com/gnustavo/Git-Hooks , PERL framework for githooks

I don't want to share all the files I worked in today because it would be too many. Just say I did a thing and that thing made me happy! :smile:

### Day 9: January 9, 2019

*Today's Progress:*
Worked on Mastering typescript. working through classes, interfaces and constructors in typescript.

*Thoughts:*
The basics make me want to fast forward but I am forcing myself to read every word and make sure I catch the details. I was thinking it would be cool to have automation that post my log to twitter so I don't have to.

### Day 8: January 8, 2019

*Today's Progress:*
Worked on Mastering typescript. finished chapter 2. 

*Thoughts:*
I wish I was quicker but since I type out all the examples it takes me longer to get through the material, but I think it sticks better because I am coding it as I go.

### Day 7: January 7, 2019

*Today's Progress:*
Busy day. Didn't move forward on any life changing code but I coded. Luckily work is coding sometimes and I did that. I update the water district prices in MS SQL server. Worked through more of the mastering typescript book.

*Thoughts:*
Need to put in the first part of my day on code or I will not make progress. The time evaporates quickly.


### Day 6: January 6, 2019

**Today's Progress:** :sunrise_over_mountains:
Worked through Chapter 1 variables.

*Thoughts:*
I don't enjoy covering basic materials but it is good to slow down and look at the basics. Typescript is so close to JS that it seems like I know all this already but there are some small things I learned. I will do this for a few days and see how it feels to spend my hour of daily coding going through the book. If it isn't as productive as I hoped I will move on to something else.

### Day 5: January 5, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
Jasmine, Mocha, Chai testing. Some wordpress updates for work.

*Thoughts:*
I didn't get to work on the book I was hoping to but I did get coding work done.

*Link to work:*
iyai website and techtonica cirriculum.


### Day 4: January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
Read very little. I had to figure out how to disable a false positive in VS Code when using typescript. This webpage helped me fix the issue (https://github.com/flowtype/flow-for-vscode#setup)

*Thoughts:*
Switching up my practice to be more guided. I have not stopped working on the iyaiContacts but I think I need to study with more of a purpose. My idea is to follow along with one of the O'Reilly books I have access to. The current one I am using is on TypeScript.

This is the book I am reading ( https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-TypeScript-Second-Nathan-Rozentals/dp/1786468719 )

by Nathan Rozentals 


### Day 3: January 3, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
Sluggish today. Not really firing on all cylinders. I did work though.

*Thoughts:*
I worked with the mongodb api route connection. Started a query to take input from the website and search for data in the database.

*Link to work:*
This is all on my machine. Link is a local path (..\CodingWorkshop\iyaiContact-express_gen).


### Day 2: January 2, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on my reverse array reps. Moved to the iyai Contacts input form. The Connection function is working but I want to understand it more.

*Thoughts:*
I am jumping around a bit with my work but I have a bunch of topics I am juggling.

### Day 1: January 1, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on reversing arrays multiple ways.

*Thoughts:*
Today was the end of a stretch of busy days and it was a holiday so I wasn't trying to do much today. This would be what I call the basics.
