### Day 58: February 27, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
- Angular6 by example

### Day 57: February 26, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* Worked on my presentation for WaffleJS. Looked at more directives in Angular6 by example.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* Today was a busy day. I got to code briefly. Went over another section of the Angular book. Most of the day was working on my Berkeley JavaScript Dojo presentation.

### Day 56: February 25, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
- BJD Kata

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* Busy day. Trying to work on something today. This is perfect for BJD katas. The kata was great. I found the one to reverse array out of place. That really worked. I was able to stretch my coding muscle and still get a little code on the record.

### Day 55: February 24, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
- Angular 6 by example 

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* Worked through more on directives in Angular. I didn't spend a lot of time coding today because I got worried about job hunting and spent time researching potential employers.

### Day 54: February 23, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
- back to Angular 6 book. I never finished the main concepts.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* Brain melt from the technical parts of angular like property vs attribute bindings. I will have to sleep on this thought.

### Day 53: February 22, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* Worked through some errors I ran into with unmock. Making it work with Jasmine was different but fruitful. Jasmine parses the modules differently so something that didn't cause a problem in Jest did in Jasmine. I also found that Jasmine will give errors trying to access module interfaces that haven't finished compiling when the test starts up. But if you let it sit for a minute it will retry and pass because those modules are loaded when the retry happens.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* I always feel I should be faster, more elegant, and smarter but I have to remember I know stuff. I was able to look at the Node.js source and start to see how Unmock overrode the http and httpClient modules to do some of the work it does.

### Day 52: February 21, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:*
- adding unmock test to BART API app. 
- Build BART API app again from scratch.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* I built the app from scratch and got new errors. That was good and bad because the same error as yesterday did not raise its head. I was able to google and work through my new test issues. I also learned that the Angular CLI and VS code don't do all the work for you. So Angular builds a spec file. VS Code will add certain lines to your code trying to help avoid simple reference errors. The issue I had is the spec file needed to import the `HttpClientModule` in order to test the service I had created. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48572621/angular-5-service-failing-to-pass-unit-tests-with-nullinjectorerror-no-provide) told me the answer and it worked.

### Day 51: February 20, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
- Angular 7 BART API app
- Angular testing

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* I worked hard to figure out how Angular API connections work. I was stuck trying to use an Observable like a JSON object so I got weird errors. Once I read the [documentation](https://angular.io/guide/http) and example a few more times I realized what was happening. Things got easier after that. I also ran into a testing error that was strange. Tomorrow I will rebuild the simple app from scratch and see if it goes away.

### Day 50: February 19, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
- Angular example
- unmock testing

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* Sometimes it is the smallest things that bring the greatest joy. I had a few angular cli warnings and I was able to resolve them. The first was my global version is higher than the local repo version I downloaded. That was easy to correct. The second was an ambiguous warning about multiple projects. I found the answer on [github](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/11532) and used it to solve my issue. For me that is next level. I didn't have to ask around I used my google-fu to fix it.

### Day 49: February 18, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
- Worked on Angular httpclient call to BART API.
- adding unmock to Angular test.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* Time time time. I keep expecting everything to go quicker than it does. I must learn to accept the amount of time I have devoted on an item as the amount of time it takes. Nuff said. Today I focused on Angular http client calls and that was educational. I also started working out how to add unmock to Angular test. I didn't get it all setup today but I made a start.

### Day 48: February 17, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* Worked with objects and APIs today. Made great progress.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* I have an API returning a large object with lots of nested data. I was having issues reading it but I looked at a few solutions. I came up with a BJD kata to go along with this.

:floppy_disk: *Link to work:* eastBayTravelApp (`...\CodingWorkshop\Angular CLI practice\eastBayTravel`)

### Day 47: February 16, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
- angular HttpClient

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* Made good progress on the httpclient. I got it working and feeling good about it.

:floppy_disk: *Link to work:*

### Day 46: February 15, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
- Software Design Docs
- Create Angular app that connects to BART API.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* I found a great article on design docs. It reminded me that I have always done this in the past just didn't realize there was a real name for it. I do it at work to make sure I can remember why it was important to do the project in the first place. I also used it as a way to get back up to speed because I would have to put things down for unknown extended amounts of times. If I was lucky it would be a day. Usually it was weeks I would work on something else. -- Having the bulleted list of today's progress helped me stay on track.

### Day 45: February 14, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
- Looking at the Unmock code base. Read what unfamiliar npm packages do. Helps me get a better understanding of what is happening in the code.
- Angular CLI

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* I am seeing things that I haven't seen done in code before. I am learning how to write better code by looking at other peoples code. I was all over the place. I read all the packages in the unmock package json. It was cool to see things they are using and trying to see how they are being implemented in the code. I learned some things but I found more to learn. I also found myself all over the place. The problem with research is it mostly requires the internet. The problem with the internet is it is full of distracting information. I worked for hours but I also went on tangents for hours. In the end it felt like half the day was productive and the other half could have been spent with more focus haha. In the end I feel good and Friday is a new day.

### Day 44: February 13, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
- Worked on unmock some more. Got it loaded on my computer.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* unmock is nice but I will have to do more testing. I also needed to figure out a technology I should use to make API calls.

:floppy_disk: *Link to work:* https://github.com/unmock/unmock-js


### Day 43: February 12, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
- UnMock course on Udemy.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* Finished the unmock Udemy course. I was able to create a github of both their repos. I looked through the code base to get an idea of what they are working on. Made some very small changes to their readme.

:floppy_disk: *Link to work:* https://www.udemy.com/building-apps-with-third-party-integrations/



### Day 42: February 11, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
- UnMock course on Udemy.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* I met Mike Solomon last week at SFNode. He talked about their company's (Meeshkan) product unmock. It has a Udemy video for it so I was working through that. I only got started this morning so I haven't had time to finish it today, but I will get into it later today when I get back.

### Day 41: February 10, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* Created a working SMS app with Twilio. 

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* Work with Twilio API some more. It was easy to create an SMS route and respond to a message. I used Heroku to deply my app instead of the ngrok they use in the example. I like Heroku and it has been a while since I used it. I am glad I did. With my more advanced knowledge of git I was able to use the heroku cli no problem. It was super easy to deploy the app.

:floppy_disk: *Link to work:* https://twil-test.herokuapp.com/


### Day 40: February 9, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* Started with Angular 6.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* I have been working with VanillaJS and that was educational but a lot of folks are using frameworks and libraries to code their applications. The framework I like and want to get better at is Angular. I will be using a book that will help with that "Building Large-Scal Web Applications with Angular" by Kevin Hennessy, Chandermani Arora, Christoffer Noring, and Doguhan Uluca. I have a subscription with oreilly press. The book is from there. I look for books that have been recently published. This is only a few months old being published in December 2018.

### Day 39: February 8, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* Work with Twilio API

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* app was super easy to set up. I only did the basics. Twilio handles a lot of the heavy lifting. I want to see how I can use it for my iyaiContacts app. One of the features is to have the user text in a contact for iyai.

:floppy_disk: *Link to work:* Twilio basic app


### Day 38: February 7, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* Finished up making the features work. 

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* I could walk away from this with a good conscience now. It needs more work but it is an MVP showing basic concepts. 

_What is left?_
- Verify user web input is valid. This avoids errors and security exploits
- "Make it pretty!" This is important but not necessary. If I plan to have people use this in a demo it will need to look nice. I planned on using bootstrapp to accomplish that.
- Refactor the code. This app could be made better by pulling duplicate code into functions.
- Code Review.

### Day 37: February 6, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* Mapped Zoho db columns to my MongoDB columns.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* This is part of that planning that needs to happen for everyone. It was funny because I didn't think about it until I made the import work. This is something that should happen at the start. Shows how rusty I am.

:floppy_disk: *Link to work:* iyaiContacts


### Day 36: February 5, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* Slow progress. I guess I always feel like it should have taken less time. Able to update the MongoDB.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* I want to do a couple more things then I will update the master with this. That will bring this closer to being done, for now.

:floppy_disk: *Link to work:* iyaiContacts


### Day 35: February 4, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* Holy smokes I made some great progress today. I didn't finish the database update to my application but I created a couple of branches for the work I am doing.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* So funny thing happened while I was working on the iyaiContact database. It wasn't in github. Doesn't sound like a big deal until you killing the app that was working to add this abstract change. I don't like breaking what works until I can fix it. Sometimes the refactor is so deep that it gets complicated to make it work again. So how would someone solve this issue. WELL a developer would add the changes as branches and leave the live production data alone. That is what I did today.
  1) created a public github repo called "iyaiContacts"
  2) pushed my current files github
  3) created remotes for this work
  4) created branches
  5) pushed my new code to the branches
  6) reverted the master back to my original working code.
I have to say I am very happy with myself. This didn't start as a github repo because I didn't think about it until I wanted to revert my changes and realized I couldn't do that without a repo.

### Day 34: February 3, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* Didn't do much.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* I had a busy day and didn't get the hour of code I like but I was able to get my computer open for a minute, so the day counts.


### Day 33: February 2, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* Working on the contacts import button. I got the import button working and displaying the data from the CSV as a table. Yay!

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* I realized that it is great that I got the csv data to display as a table. I was working on the wrong issue. Somewhere I got crossed and worried about displaying the data before it was added to the MongoDB. I need to figure out adding the data to my MongoDB. That shouldn't be a big issue but I have to plan it. The headers in the CSV don't match my current DB schema. Zoho has more data than I need. The labels for that data don't match the fields I am using in my MongoDB. I will need to do some data massaging to get it to match what I want before importing. All in all things are going well but I got so focused on solving one issue that I worked in the wrong direction for a little bit. If that makes sense to all of you.

:floppy_disk: *Link to work:* iyaiContacts


### Day 32: February 1, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* I finally got the regex experession I needed to parse the csv data. Something is off by one but I am going to push forward and troubleshoot that in the future. I have it close enough to move on to the rest of my code. This part of the application will allow the user to import a csv file from ZohoCRM. I will have more imports in the future but I plan to have the company use ZohoCRM along side this app.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* It seems I was overthinking the regex. I went to stackoverflow in frustration. Which led me to copy and paste complicated solutions I didn't fully understand. AND none of them worked the way I needed. So I took a deep breath and started working it out myself, again. That worked! Yay. It is the small success that can sometimes feel the best.

:floppy_disk: *Link to work:* iyaiContacts


### Day 31: January 31, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* Working on parsing data from CSV. I am trying to think through this myself.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* So far so good. I can think through it but I am learning regex and that is slowing me down. I like that I can puzzle my way through this. Makes me feel better.

:floppy_disk: *Link to work:* iyaiContacts


### Day 30: January 30, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* None.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* I coded a little here and there today but I made little to NO progress. I did get a better understanding of how JavaScript Modulus operator works. It is still confusing but now I know why it is not giving back the remainder.

:floppy_disk: *Link to work:* iyaiContacts



### Day 29: January 29, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* I am working on an import feature that will allow the user to import zoho CRM contacts. I got part of the feature working. The user is able to select a file and those results are printed to the screen. Next step is to load that data into a variable that will transport it to the MongoDB and stored permanently.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* I had to get help on this. I don't usually read files from the local machine with JavaScript. I found the API FileReader. It is suggested to use the array buffer method, but I have never worked with array buffers before. I was lucky and found some functions to help me convert from array buffer to string. I will play with this some more. Even though I got it to work I don't fully understand everything happening unde
r the hood.

### Day 28: January 28, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* Fixed issue with searching database and displaying data to website.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* I feel like I spend too much time on simple stuff. I found what my problem was. I have a looping issue but I am moving on because it is only adding 1 extra line to my output. I can fix that at a later date. Since I have spent so much time working on this item I want to move on.

:floppy_disk: *Link to work:* iyaiContacts webpage


### Day 27: January 27, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* Worked on the contacts page more. I am stuck trying to query the db to find matching contacts.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* Times like this I get frustrated. I thought I had this but when I try to go in and make the request I get errors. This time I am stuck on req.body vs req.params vs req.query. Which has my data. I see it being sent but the API is not processing it properly. Which is my fault. I will find it soon enough but frustrating not to get it immediately. This is not the first time I have had this issue. Once I find the correct syntax then it is easy.


### Day 26: January 26, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* Worked for a long time trying to add a nested list using vanilla javascript.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* It is times like this I don't feel so smart. I spent a long time working with nodes and appending the data being retrieved from the api call. I am trying to add the nodes and content but it is not working as expected. If I plan to be awesome in the field I need to get this kind of stuff down.

:floppy_disk: *Link to work:*

### Day 25: January 25, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* Finished the Mastering Typescript book. 

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* It started off fine but then the later more advanced samples didn't have enough Typescript to keep me interested. I was skimming through sections because most of it was dealing with other frameworks that were outdated. I know that Angular for example is on version 7 not 2 and it wouldn't help me to go learn 2 becasue I am not working on that type of project. I don't want to learn something that I feel I will have to unlearn. Also some of the Typescript examples were just showing me what npm packages to include more than how to use Typescript to craft something special. The book could have stopped halfway through and I would have been content.


### Day 24: January 24, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* Still working through Mastering Typescript. On chapter dealing with modularization. I skipped some of the framework specific sections before this one. 

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* The book is okay. I think it spends too much time on framework specific uses of Typescript. But I have found useful parts for me. Oh yeah it could have spent more time on setting up a build server with Typescript.

### Day 23: January 23, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* I wanted to work on my iyai contacts project. Made some progress this morning.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:* I really need to keep my nose to the grind stone the mastering typescript book. BUT I was so close to having my iyai contact issue solved that I wanted to finish that. I can't have too much time away from my projects.


### Day 22: January 22, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
I worked through another chapter of the Mastering Typescript book. Ended part way into TDD chapter focused on Jasmine.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:*
It is more fun when I am covering something that is or seems exciting. Like Jasmine testing. I need to write more test and it was exciting to crack into TypeScript and testing. I am intrigued to see how it is done.

### Day 21: January 21, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
Working through more of the Mastering Typescript book. Chapter 6 is covering older libraries so I skipped past it because I would have to relearn it later with the updates. Might as well work with the modern versions from the start, since I have a choice. I wouldn't skip if I needed to work with old code.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:*
I had to skip some material because it was dated but I did like the section on React. Probably because I don't know much about React so this was informative. I had to laugh a little because React adds extra steps to the development process but my coding peers seem to LOVE it. I don't get it but maybe with some experience I will. I am still an Angular (version 7) fanboy.


### Day 20: January 20, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
Got an answer for my API issue this morning. I needed to write my function to return a promise. After that issue was resolved. I moved on to Mastering TypeScript. Working with declarations more.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:*
I was happy to get an answer to my API issue. But I lost points on stackoverflow because they deemed it a duplicate question. I don't agree but I can't change it so whatever. I got the answer I needed and that is what really matters... TO ME. It shows I need to work with promises and get to understand asynch functions in JavaScript. I knew there was an async issue but I didn't know how to resolve it. As for Mastering Typescript, I am bored. The declarations section covers things that I won't do regularly but still need to know. Excited to move on to testing in a couple chapters, but for now 3rd party libraries are next.

### Day 19: January 19, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
Worked on an error I am getting from another project. My API is not returning data to the webpage, which is a problem I am getting help with. The rest of my time I am working on declaration files in the Mastering Typescript book.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:*
The API issue I am trying to handle is going through stackoverflow. I wrote a question that didn't have enough information for folks to help me. It is a balance trying to include enough code so other can help you and not including your entire code base. I struggle with this every time I ask a question on there. The other work I did this hour was to work through my book and that went quick. Today's practice was really trying to get the work in today and not miss it.

### Day 18: January 18, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
Finished chapter 4 with generics etc. Now time to move on.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:*
The whole chapter was interesting and will need to be revisited. I won't be re-reading this chapter but looking for chances to use generics, decorators and async. The examples in the book had issues. I think part of the problem was my ts compiler was set to es5. Things got a lot better when I bumped it up to es2015. All this is important material and I plan to practice it until I have it down.

### Day 17: January 17, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
Worked through more of the mastering typescript book. Finished up generics today.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:*
I can tell that I don't have a strong grasp of abstract classes, implements, and super(). I kind of get them but I struggle to fix them when there is a bug. That is okay. The foundation is there I just need more examples to strengthen my understanding.

### Day 16: January 16, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
Made good progress on Mastering Typescript. started next part of chapter.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:*
alot of the begining work was causing compile errors, which makes it harder for me to follow. I need working examples so I can see what works for the computer. Since these are experimental I didn't stress on it. I have moved to generics and that is much more straight forward, even though I am ending on a compile error because I ran out of time. Must go to an appointment NOW!!

### Day 15: January 15, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
Got into Typescript decorators.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:*
This was a bit frustrating because the decorators are Ecmascript7 and experimental in typescript. I think the books examples were in an older format so every time I went to compile I got errors. I didn't want to get sucked into a black hole of trying to fix the issue. You sometimes have to cut your losses. If something is experimental and you don't have a lot of time then that would be something to come back to later.

### Day 14: January 14, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
Did a great summary of interfaces, classes and inheritance with a factory design pattern.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:*
I enjoyed covering those concepts I just refreshed myself on yesterday. The example isn't perfect so I have compile bugs every time that I need to fix and that has been super duper helpful. I get to puzzle through what the error is telling me.

### Day 13: January 13, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
Finished up the chapter on classes. Tired and busy but made it happen.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:*
I enjoyed it, but my brain started to get scrambled when they introduced abstract classes. Plus I was annoyed having to write a constructor for every class. abstraction and extending is something I will have to play around with more.

### Day 12: January 12, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
I worked through part of a chapter in Mastering Typescript by Nathan Rozentals.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:*
I am in the classes and inheritance chapter. I must like OOP because I get excited when I can cover concepts like inheritance and get/set. I didn't realize it because I have been focusing on JS lately and there is less opportunity to do that with JS. Hopefully I will get to put more time in on this chapter today but we will see how things shape up.

### Day 11: January 11, 2019

:sunrise_over_mountains::sunny: *Today's Progress:* 
Worked through more mastering typescript.

:thought_balloon: *Thoughts:*
Same thing as the other day. I know the concepts so going through it is tough to do, but I need to if I plan on learning this the right way. This makes me want to skip over sections but I don't know the Typescript way of dealing with this concepts so that means I have to stick with it. Once I make it through the rewards will be evident. 

:floppy_disk: *Link to work:*
When I go through basics I save the code samples to a file that I can reference later. This is my way of taking notes with live code.

### Day 10: January 10, 2019

*Today's Progress:*

I worked on Jasmine, Mocha, Chai testing. Basic slides showing how to test JavaScript.

later I got sucked into a blackhole looking for ways to make githooks. This is a whole area I would need to dive into. Plus strengthen my shell scripting skills. I would prefer to use Powershell of scripting since I am on a windows machine, but I found a perl framework that might be more universal for working with a team.

I was able to get my time in with Mastering Typescript later on. Now I feel like I made progress for the day.

*Thoughts:*

I am posting this idea for tomorrow (day 10). Work on integrating Github commits with Twitter post. I feel like it is more time than I want to spend making individual posts to Twitter. But posting to Twitter daily is what motivates others and helps me get visibility so it is important for the bigger picture. BUT why not automate that menial tasks with code.

Resources (from a quick Google search):
- https://gist.github.com/kylefrost/f3841e76749dc64f4b5e (not really working any longer)
- https://zapier.com/apps/github/integrations/twitter
- https://ifttt.com/connect/github/twitter

API links:
- https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/post-and-engage/overview
- https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#commitcommentevent

all Github api calls go to (https://api.github.com)

Githooks could be another approach ( https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks )
- https://githooks.com/ , has examples
- https://github.com/gnustavo/Git-Hooks , PERL framework for githooks

I don't want to share all the files I worked in today because it would be too many. Just say I did a thing and that thing made me happy! :smile:

### Day 9: January 9, 2019

*Today's Progress:*
Worked on Mastering typescript. working through classes, interfaces and constructors in typescript.

*Thoughts:*
The basics make me want to fast forward but I am forcing myself to read every word and make sure I catch the details. I was thinking it would be cool to have automation that post my log to twitter so I don't have to.

### Day 8: January 8, 2019

*Today's Progress:*
Worked on Mastering typescript. finished chapter 2. 

*Thoughts:*
I wish I was quicker but since I type out all the examples it takes me longer to get through the material, but I think it sticks better because I am coding it as I go.

### Day 7: January 7, 2019

*Today's Progress:*
Busy day. Didn't move forward on any life changing code but I coded. Luckily work is coding sometimes and I did that. I update the water district prices in MS SQL server. Worked through more of the mastering typescript book.

*Thoughts:*
Need to put in the first part of my day on code or I will not make progress. The time evaporates quickly.


### Day 6: January 6, 2019

**Today's Progress:** :sunrise_over_mountains:
Worked through Chapter 1 variables.

*Thoughts:*
I don't enjoy covering basic materials but it is good to slow down and look at the basics. Typescript is so close to JS that it seems like I know all this already but there are some small things I learned. I will do this for a few days and see how it feels to spend my hour of daily coding going through the book. If it isn't as productive as I hoped I will move on to something else.

### Day 5: January 5, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
Jasmine, Mocha, Chai testing. Some wordpress updates for work.

*Thoughts:*
I didn't get to work on the book I was hoping to but I did get coding work done.

*Link to work:*
iyai website and techtonica cirriculum.


### Day 4: January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
Read very little. I had to figure out how to disable a false positive in VS Code when using typescript. This webpage helped me fix the issue (https://github.com/flowtype/flow-for-vscode#setup)

*Thoughts:*
Switching up my practice to be more guided. I have not stopped working on the iyaiContacts but I think I need to study with more of a purpose. My idea is to follow along with one of the O'Reilly books I have access to. The current one I am using is on TypeScript.

This is the book I am reading ( https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-TypeScript-Second-Nathan-Rozentals/dp/1786468719 )

### Day 3: January 3, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
Sluggish today. Not really firing on all cylinders. I did work though.

*Thoughts:*
I worked with the mongodb api route connection. Started a query to take input from the website and search for data in the database.

*Link to work:*
This is all on my machine. Link is a local path (..\CodingWorkshop\iyaiContact-express_gen).


### Day 2: January 2, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on my reverse array reps. Moved to the iyai Contacts input form. The Connection function is working but I want to understand it more.

*Thoughts:*
I am jumping around a bit with my work but I have a bunch of topics I am juggling.

### Day 1: January 1, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on reversing arrays multiple ways.

*Thoughts:*
Today was the end of a stretch of busy days and it was a holiday so I wasn't trying to do much today. This would be what I call the basics.
