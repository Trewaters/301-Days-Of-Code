### Day 2: [Date]

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on my reverse array reps. Moved to the iyai Contacts input form. The Connection function is working but I want to understand it more.

**Thoughts:**
I am jumping around a bit with my work but I have a bunch of topics I am juggling.

**Link to work:**
This is all on my machine. Linke is a local path (..\CodingWorkshop\iyaiContact-express_gen).

### Day 1: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on reversing arrays multiple ways.

**Thoughts:**
Today was the end of a stretch of busy days and it was a holiday so I wasn't trying to do much today. This would be what I call the basics.
