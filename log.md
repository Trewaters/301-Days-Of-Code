The daily log of Tre' Grisby's **#301DaysOfCode** challenge.

### Day 4: January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
Read very little. I had to figure out how to disable a false positive in VS Code when using typescript. This webpage helped me fix the issue (https://github.com/flowtype/flow-for-vscode#setup)

**Thoughts:**
Switching up my practice to be more guided. I have not stopped working on the iyaiContacts but I think I need to study with more of a purpose. My idea is to follow along with one of the O'Reilly books I have access to. The current one I am using is on TypeScript.

This is the book I am reading ( https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-TypeScript-Second-Nathan-Rozentals/dp/1786468719 )

### Day 3: January 3, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
Sluggish today. Not really firing on all cylinders. I did work though.

**Thoughts:**
I worked with the mongodb api route connection. Started a query to take input from the website and search for data in the database.

This is all on my machine. Link is a local path (..\CodingWorkshop\iyaiContact-express_gen).

### Day 2: January 2, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on my reverse array reps. Moved to the iyai Contacts input form. The Connection function is working but I want to understand it more.

**Thoughts:**
I am jumping around a bit with my work but I have a bunch of topics I am juggling.

### Day 1: January 1, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on reversing arrays multiple ways.

**Thoughts:**
Today was the end of a stretch of busy days and it was a holiday so I wasn't trying to do much today. This would be what I call the basics.
