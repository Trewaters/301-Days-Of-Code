The daily log of Tre' Grisby's **#301DaysOfCode** challenge.

## Log

### Day 7: January 7, 2019

*Today's Progress:*
Busy day. Didn't move forward on any life changing code but I coded. Luckily work is coding sometimes and I did that. I update the water district prices in MS SQL server. Worked through more of the mastering typescript book.

*Thoughts:*
Need to put in the first part of my day on code or I will not make progress. The time evaporates quickly.

*Link to work:*
None.


### Day #: January 6, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
Worked through Chapter 1 variables.

*Thoughts:*
I don't enjoy covering basic materials but it is good to slow down and look at the basics. Typescript is so close to JS that it seems like I know all this already but there are some small things I learned. I will do this for a few days and see how it feels to spend my hour of daily coding going through the book. If it isn't as productive as I hoped I will move on to something else.

### Day #: January 5, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
Jasmine, Mocha, Chai testing. Some wordpress updates for work.

*Thoughts:*
I didn't get to work on the book I was hoping to but I did get coding work done.

*Link to work:*
iyai website and techtonica cirriculum.


### Day 4: January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
Read very little. I had to figure out how to disable a false positive in VS Code when using typescript. This webpage helped me fix the issue (https://github.com/flowtype/flow-for-vscode#setup)

*Thoughts:*
Switching up my practice to be more guided. I have not stopped working on the iyaiContacts but I think I need to study with more of a purpose. My idea is to follow along with one of the O'Reilly books I have access to. The current one I am using is on TypeScript.

This is the book I am reading ( https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-TypeScript-Second-Nathan-Rozentals/dp/1786468719 )
Mastering TypeScript - Second Edition 2nd Revised edition Edition

### Day 3: January 3, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
Sluggish today. Not really firing on all cylinders. I did work though.

*Thoughts:*
I worked with the mongodb api route connection. Started a query to take input from the website and search for data in the database.

*Link to work:*
This is all on my machine. Link is a local path (..\CodingWorkshop\iyaiContact-express_gen).


### Day 2: January 2, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on my reverse array reps. Moved to the iyai Contacts input form. The Connection function is working but I want to understand it more.

*Thoughts:*
I am jumping around a bit with my work but I have a bunch of topics I am juggling.

### Day 1: January 1, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on reversing arrays multiple ways.

*Thoughts:*
Today was the end of a stretch of busy days and it was a holiday so I wasn't trying to do much today. This would be what I call the basics.
